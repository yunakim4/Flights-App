# Flights-App
1.
a. One thing that I learned is how to use transactions to make our code parallel and concurrent, and be able to have
multiple users using it at once
b. One thing that surprised me is that I was able to make a database application that works with several users. 
It surprised me how I am able to learn new things, and it surprised me how much debugging
actually went into making this simple application work
c. Are we able to connect this database application with UI and make a web application for it?


2. No I did not get my question answered but one way I can is to do some internet searches, and maybe figure out how these skills apply in my future career

3. Based on what we did for this java application, I would personally make the CEO nullable. I feel that there is a simple
way to check for this (maybe check if the CEO's manager is an empty string (which implies there's no manager)). Like how I did
to check if fid2 is null (if fid is less than or equal to 0 then it implies theres no fid).
